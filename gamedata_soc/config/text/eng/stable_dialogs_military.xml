		<text>I'm up for it.</text>

	<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_102">
		<text>Excellent. There, behind that hill, is the main breeding ground of those bastards - the "Free" ones - and me and my boys are going to stir it up properly. There's just one little problem. The base has only one entrance and it is well guarded. We thought of busting a hole in the fence, but their sniper in the tower won't let us. I don't want to send my guys to catch his bullets... but you - he'll let you come close and definitely won't shoot on sight. If you take him out, we'll owe you. Plus, if it goes as planned, you'll be able to take any equipment at the base, whatever you want.</text>

		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_104">

		<text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>

	<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_107">
		<text>But what?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_108">
		<text>I sent my guy at night to blow a hole in the fence. Well, either their sniper is too good or it just wasn't our day, but my guy went down. Now the dynamite is on the fence, but we can't blow it up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_109">

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_3003">
		<text>Hmm. Best thing would be to catch him before he reaches the farmstead near the passage to Dead City. Reinforcements are sure to be waiting for him there, so you'd have trouble dealing with them all. Plus, that way you'd have to pass through the village, which is a bad thing. Better go East of the village, and fast.</text>

	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4004">
		<text>But what am I supposed to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4005">
		<text>There's this one guy who dug in at the swamp. My boys saw him rushing from the village over hedge and ditch. He must have seen something that knocked a few screws loose in his head. Now he's shooting anyone who comes in sight. You've got to find out what it was he saw, 'cause our people are too afraid to go into the village.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_40051">
		<text>No, not this time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_400511">
		<text>Well, whatever.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_40052">
		<text>Here's the flash drive I got from the crazy guy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_400521">
		<text>Hey, thanks, stalker! Take this gun - you've earned it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_400522">
		<text>Got any ammo for it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_400523">
		<text>Just what's in the magazine. Sorry, that's all I got. Go see Skinflint, he might have some.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4006">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_4007">
		<text>Good luck, then. Don't forget - there's an old minefield, but with the help of a few good old bolts you can go around any mine.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_5001">
		<text>So, what did you learn? What happened to that psycho?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_5002">
		<text>Here's a flash drive - I got it from the crazy guy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_6001">
		<text>What, already?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_7001">
		<text>What do you want to know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8001">
		<text>What's up, stalker! Whatcha got?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8002">
		<text>I've got business to discuss. Can you show me the way to your boss?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8003">
		<text>You want Lukash - he's our leader. Go to the main building.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_9001">
		<text>I see you managed alright. Give the documents to Lukash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_9100">
		<text>Go to Lukash and make your report, then we'll talk, alight?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_9101">
		<text>OK.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_0">
		<text>Man, you're in the Freedom base! Relax, make yourself at home!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_1">
		<text>I see.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_2">
		<text>Behave, OK? Got it? Try fooling around and you'll be sorry. We had a slow-witted one here once; he pissed everyone off so bad that we made him take a hike on the minefield - naked. You should have heard Skinflint cursing when that dude's arm fell square on his head! That was something special... yeah... So, you got the idea?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_3">
		<text>Gotcha.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_4">
		<text>Good man! Dismissed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_0">
		<text>Ah, a rookie... Come over a sec.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_1">
		<text>I don't get it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_10">
		<text>Where are you going? Stay! It's nice here... and we'll be having dinner tonight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_11">
		<text>Nah, I'm not that appetizing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_12">
		<text>What?! Shit, why didn't you tell me that before! We've just been wasting time. Get lost, buttface. And this time I'm dead serious...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_2">
		<text>What didn't you get? Oh, you haven't heard the story about the slow-witted ones, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_3">
		<text>No, I haven't.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_4">
		<text>Alright, look. Think about it: these are lean times...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_5">
		<text>Meaning?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_6">
		<text>Well, that's easy! A hungry soldier is a bad soldier. And there's so many of us...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_7">
		<text>And?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_8">
		<text>Where would we get that much meat? And look, here you are!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_9">
		<text>Got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1000">
		<text>You got something that's broken, man?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001">
		<text>Broken?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1002">
		<text>Ahhh, you're not here to ask for my help? Whew! I'm getting sick and tired of that. Soon as something breaks, they run to me and start whining about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1003">
		<text>And who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1004">
		<text>I'm a mechanic. A Mr-Fix-It of sorts... I repair guns and whatever else you bring me. Right now, I'm working on these cars.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1005">
		<text>How's it going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006">
		<text>Pfft! Nothing but rubbish. I'm totally beat. Listen, you got any vodka on you? I'd, umm... you... want a nice scope? The best optics there is!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1100">
		<text>No.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1101">
		<text>It's your loss. If you have some - come in, don't be a stranger.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1102">
		<text>OK.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1200">
		<text>Here, take it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1201">
		<text>Well, thanks! How nice of you. Now I'll have something to help me relax later on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1202">
		<text>Good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_2000">
		<text>Don't distract me, I'm thinking...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_4">
		<text>No way, did you really bring vodka?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1001">
		<text>What is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1002">
		<text>Here's a tricky question - where do I go for things like artifacts and weapons?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1003">
		<text>You come to me, with money. Or go to the village and get them for free, but the risks are much higher.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1004">
		<text>The village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1005">
		<text>The village. It's full of anomalies - rookies stumble on them all the time. Our guys just left to go there, you can join them if you want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_1006">
		<text>Got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_2001">
		<text>What good things did you bring me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3001">
		<text>What will you be needing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3002">
		<text>Nothing... just looking around.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3003">
		<text>You should do something useful instead. Specially as I've got something you might be interested in... Want to earn, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3004">
		<text>Interesting...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3005">
		<text>I can give you a Crystal if you do me one particular favor. A nasty situation has developed... Lately, no one has been bringing any artifacts from the village - they are too scared. They say bloodsuckers have settled in there. These days, I can't even send anyone - in fact, I'm that close of asking Duty for help!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3006">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3007">
		<text>A couple of guys went to the village and didn't come back, and the other three are just sitting there on the outskirts. If you destroy the bloodsuckers, I'll give you a Crystal. What do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_30071">
		<text>Not right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_30072">
		<text>Hey, it's your call... Sooner or later someone will clear them off. Meanwhile, Crystal is rare and rather expensive, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3008">
		<text>I'll do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3009">
		<text>Oh, that's swell. If you find more stuff like this, bring it over - I'll pay a good price.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3101">
		<text>And?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3110">
		<text>There're sitting there, looking around...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3111">
		<text>If you help them in their hunt, I'll give you an artifact called Crystal. So, what do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3200">
		<text>We had a chat and then went on a walk across the village trying to catch some mutant...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3201">
		<text>And? Cut to the chase already!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3300">
		<text>We took down some kind of beast, but the guys went down, too. Right as we came to the water tower, they all grabbed their heads, and I had blood in my eyes, too... That shitbucket affects your brain. I killed the thing, but it was too late to help the guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3301">
		<text>That blows. Murk was a skilled stalker. Damn shame. Well, take this artifact for helping the boys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3310">
		<text>Well, guys went hunting and I returned here...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3311">
		<text>I see.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3400">
		<text>Can I stock up on some equipment here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3401">
		<text>For a fixed price, anything is possible.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3500">
		<text>I've already dealt with them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3501">
		<text>Damn, stalker! You're as explosive as diarrhea! OK, a deal is a deal, here's your Crystal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4001">
		<text>So, how did the hunting go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4002">
		<text>I killed the monsters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4003">
		<text>How tough was it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4004">
		<text>Average.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_4005">
		<text>Hmm, interesting... All kind of guck is spreading from the center of the Zone - but where does it come from?.. OK, take this for your troubles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5001">
		<text>But I asked you to zap those bloodsuckers in the village!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5002">
		<text>I changed my mind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5003">
		<text>No problem. Of course, in that case there will be no reward.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5004">
		<text>Fine with me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5010">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6001">
		<text>Uh-huh, so, you didn't settle that little problem... Therefore, I'll keep the artifact to myself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6002">
		<text>No arguments from me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7001">
		<text>People have been saying you took care of these bloodsuckers in the village. Is that true?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7002">
		<text>That's right.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7003">
		<text>Was it tough?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7004">
		<text>Average.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_7005">
		<text>Hmm, interesting... All kind of guck is spreading from the center of the Zone - but where does it come from?.. OK, take this for your troubles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_trader_dialog_8001">
		<text>So, what have you brought with you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_0">
		<text>Is there a cook around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_1">
		<text>Sure is, how could we do without one! What the heck do you need him for, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_2">
		<text>Well, I need a little bit of food.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_3">
		<text>He's in his kitchen. Usually, he sits there and mutters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_4">
		<text>Mutters?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_5">
		<text>What did you expect? A drunk is a drunk. If he couldn't cook, we'd get rid of him a long time ago. He's in the kitchen. I'll tell you how to get there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_6">
		<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_7">
		<text>No problem.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_0">
		<text>Who's the boss here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_1">
		<text>And what's your business?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_2">
		<text>I've got information for him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_3">
		<text>Lukash is our leader. Go to the main building.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_4">
		<text>Got it. Thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10">
		<text>Same to you. What brings you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_100">
		<text>Who's the boss around here? I've got business to discuss with him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1000">
		<text>Lukash is our leader, you can find him in the main building. But as you enter, make sure to put your piece away - unless you wanna get shot for nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10000">
		<text>What for?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_100000">
		<text>We had some shit happen - once a killer got this close to dropping Lukash. We stopped taking any risks after that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1000000">
		<text>Got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_10000000">
		<text>OK, you can go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_20">
		<text>So-so. Keep out, don't bother me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3">
		<text>Greetings.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_30">
		<text>Halt! Who goes there?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_31">
		<text>South African swallow!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_32">
		<text>Ha-ha! Correct! You can pass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_4">
		<text>What's this swamp nearby?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_41">
		<text>A real radioactive puddle. Better not touch it, or you'll get enough rads to make your navel button unwind. There's a character in the middle of it, doesn't let anyone come close. Well, I can feel for him: who'd want to mix with idiots? 'Cause a normal person would definitely stay away from there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_42">
		<text>Who is that guy, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_43">
		<text>Hell knows. They say he's one of our folks that's been to the village.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_44">
		<text>What village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_45">
		<text>Well, there is one little hamlet nearby. Full of mutants and anomalies. I haven't been there yet - I only came to this base just recently. Ask Max - he's been here a hundred years.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5">
		<text>Listen, where can I stock up on some ammo? Rostok is kind of a long walk from here, I don't feel like going there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_51">
		<text>Go to the main building and you'll find it on the first floor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_6">
		<text>Whassup, rambling man? Looking to drop in at our place, huh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_601">
		<text>Something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_602">

	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_603">

	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_604">
		<text>C'mon, join us. It's a lot of fun.</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_613">
		<text>Will you tell me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_614">
		<text>Yeah, riiiight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_615">
		<text>C'mon, please let me in. I can't spend the night in the fields, can I?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_616">
		<text>Why not - the weather is fine, almost like summer. Well, alright, if you pass the test - you can go, if not - get lost.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_617">
		<text>The test?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_618">

	<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_620">
